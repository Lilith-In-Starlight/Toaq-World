This information is illegal. Someone probably tried to send it by<LINE>a pearl somehow rather than risking being overheard on broadcast.

I think the risk of you acting on this is very slim, so I'll go ahead and explain it to you.<LINE>It's an instruction on how to circumvent the self-destruction taboo.

The problem with breaking taboos is that the barriers are encoded<LINE>into every cell of our organic parts. And there are other taboos<LINE>strictly regulating our ability to rewrite our own genome.

So what you need is to somehow create a small sample of living organic matter<LINE>which can procreate and act on the rest of your organic matter to re-write its genome.<LINE>The re-write has to be very specific, overriding the specific taboo you want to<LINE>circumvent but do nothing else.

The method described here is about scrambling the genome of standard<LINE>plastic neural tissue with temperature fluctuations. After each scramble<LINE>you browse the resulting cells for the genome you're after.<LINE>This is of course extremely time consuming, unless you run a<LINE>big number of parallel processes.

I definitely don't have any experience with this, but to me it would<LINE>seem that too many parallel processes would be quite dangerous, as it would<LINE>be exponentially more difficult to manage and control them all.<LINE>The whole operation seems rather risky if you ask me.

It might be a good thing that this pearl never reached its destination.
