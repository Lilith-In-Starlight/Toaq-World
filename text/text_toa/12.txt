Kao be'ẹshuaq ní bộbaı shúaqjıo bẹjoqshaqtıe da. Du ꝡä po túqsıe hao ní da. Ma kaqgaı súq<LINE>sá jóqshaqtıe bẹkuoq móq? Chı bu jí, kûı shıao tú mea máq, sîu cáqbo maqbo da.

In ancient times the masks were actually about showing spiritual persuasion - covering the<LINE>face as a way to symbolically abate the self. Then of course, that was quite subverted as<LINE>excessively ornate and lavish masks became an expression of identity. Some public persons<LINE>did have problems with narrow doorways.

Originally monks in a temple would make the masks using bone plaster, and when the production was automated it would<LINE>generally remain on the same site. So that the old stones could... radiate the material with holiness, I suppose.

This is from one such facility called Side House, which was here on Pebble's grounds. In the iterator projects many<LINE>old industrial-religious sites like this were remodeled and incorporated. I think this one was made to provide pellets<LINE>of holy ash to Pebbles, but knowing him he probably hasn't used much of it!
