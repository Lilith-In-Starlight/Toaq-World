It's an old text. The verses are familiar to me, but I don't remember by whom they were written.<LINE>The language is very old and intricate.

The first verse starts by drawing a comparison between the world and a tangled rug.<LINE>It says that the world is an unfortunate mess. Like a knot, the nature of its existence<LINE>is the fact that the parts are locking each other, none able to spring free.

Then as it goes on the world becomes a furry animal hide, I suppose... because now us living<LINE>beings are like insects crawling in the fur. And then it's a fishing net, because the more we<LINE>struggle and squirm, the more entangled we become.

It says that only the limp body of the jellyfish cannot be captured in the net.<LINE>So we should try to be like the jellyfish, because the jellyfish doesn't try.

This was an eternal dilemma to them - they were burdened by great ambition,<LINE>yet deeply convinced that striving in itself was an unforgivable vice.<LINE>They tried very hard to be effortless. Perhaps that's what we were to them,<LINE>someone to delegate that unrestrained effort to.

I know I have tried very hard.
