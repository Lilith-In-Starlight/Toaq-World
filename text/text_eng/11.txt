It's a Small Plate, a little text of spiritual guidance.<LINE>It's written by a monk called Four Cabinets, Eleven Hatchets.<LINE>It's old, several ages before the Void Fluid revolution.

Like most writing from this time it’s quite shrouded in analogies, but the subject is how to shed<LINE>one of the five natural urges which tie a creature to life. Namely number four, gluttony.

It is basically an instruction on how to starve yourself<LINE>on herbal tea and gravel, but disguised as a poem.

Now of course when Void Fluid was discovered these methods proved obsolete, as it was<LINE>more easy just jumping in a vat of it to effortlessly leave this world behind.

There were some horror stories though... That if your ego was big enough, not even the Void Fluid could<LINE>entirely cross you out, and a faint echo of your pompousness would grandiosely haunt the premises forever.

So even when the Void Fluid baths became cheaper,<LINE>some would still starve and drink the bitter tea.
